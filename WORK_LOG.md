| December 2 | 7:00-8:00pm | First, I began to think about patterns in human language. When we first began compression I remembered that the main point of compression is that you look for patterns in files, and then represent those files with a smaller numbner of bits. In the abra text case, there is a clear pattern, "abra." However, the problem is we don't know how to find these patterns efficiently. This is when I realized that our goal was to create an algorithm that could somehow find patterns in text and somehow replace those patterns with somehting that takes up less storage. So, I started thinking about the criteria for being a pattern. Obviously, we cannot make one or two letters be a pattern because the number of bits you would represent those one/two letters would probably exceed the number of bits it would take to store them normally. So, I thought of one last question: where do we draw that line? |

I remembered Lucas talking in class about using hashing, and I remembered that you, Mr. Blick, said he was fairly close. However, I didn't get very far with this idea and decided to move back to my original ideas. I decided to not worry too much for the time being about my previous question about where to draw the line where a pattern is too small. Now, I was considering the question of how to _find_ a pattern in a text. I didn't think that a single word would be long enough to be a pattern. |

Because there are so many different words that can come after each other, and I just feel like it is super unlikely for there to be multiple of the same consecutive string of words in a text. Could graph theory be used for this somehow? I felt like I just kept on confusing myself the more I thought about finding patterns in text. |
