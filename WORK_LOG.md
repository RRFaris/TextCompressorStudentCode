| December 2  |  7:00-8:00pm  | First, I began to think about patterns in human language. When we first began compression I remembered that the main point of compression is that you look for patterns in files, and then represent those files with a smaller numbner of bits. In the abra text case, there is a clear pattern, "abra." However, the problem is we don't know how to find these patterns efficiently. This is when I realized that our goal was to create an algorithm that could somehow find patterns in text and somehow replace those patterns with somehting that takes up less storage. So, I started thinking about the criteria for being a pattern. Obviously, we cannot make one or two letters be a pattern because the number of bits you would represent those one/two letters would probably exceed the number of bits it would take to store them normally. So, I thought of one last question: where do we draw that line? |

I remembered Lucas talking in class about using hashing, and I remembered that you, Mr. Blick, said he was fairly close. However, I didn't get very far with this idea and decided to move back to my original ideas. I decided to not worry too much for the time being about my previous question about where to draw the line where a pattern is too small. Now, I was considering the question of how to _find_ a pattern in a text. I didn't think that a single word would be long enough to be a pattern. |

Because there are so many different words that can come after each other, and I just feel like it is super unlikely for there to be multiple of the same consecutive string of words in a text. Could graph theory be used for this somehow? I felt like I just kept on confusing myself the more I thought about finding patterns in text. |

At the end of class though, I had some extra time to look at some of the methods used in Mr. Blick's TST class. Looking back at the pseudocode, I realized that getLongestPrefix would probably be useful. |

In class I only had enough time to write out the whole method, and I wasn't able to test it. |

Oliver showed me a way how to use the debugger even when running in the terminal, so I used that to look at my code for errors. This was when I realized that all of the prefixes were just 1 letter long. That is when I realized that I initialized my tst with 256 values of ascii, and not 128. This caused all of the extra slots to fill up, so no new prefixes could be made. Once I changed that, it worked! |

I started by writing some pseudocode in a comment so I would have an idea on how to code it. I took the rest of the time to try to use the pseudocode as scafold so I could build the method. |

Once I finished correcting those, I saw that the file almost expanded correctly. However, for every prefix that had more than 1 letter, it seemed to double each letter in it. This was really confusing for me because I thought that it was a problem with my expand method. After a lot of debugging, I realized that the error actually came from my compress method. After fixing it, it worked! |

To do it, I just looked at the slides again to refresh my memory, and then I just added an if statement to my expand method which made it work for every file! |
